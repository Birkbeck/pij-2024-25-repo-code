/**
 * Example class to demonstrate how to generate tests for a given class
 * via keyboard shortcut in IntelliJ: Use Alt-Insert on a PC (Windows/Linux)
 * or Cmd-N on a Mac. (Alternative: right mouse button for context menu, then
 * select "Generate".)
 *
 * Then click on "Test...". Then confirm for JUnit 5. A test class called
 * BobTest will be generated for you in the same package, in the folder
 * that you have marked for as "Test Sources Root" in your project.
 * (If you have not yet marked a folder as "Test Sources Root", it is a
 * good idea to do so, so that your JUnit tests are separate from your
 * production code.)
